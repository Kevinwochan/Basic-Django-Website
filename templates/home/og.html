				<p>“Encouraging student to hack for the future of fintech”
				
				From remote mobile payments to peer-to-peer lending, Australians have truly embraced fintech. To make Australia a future global leader in fintech, Textbook Ventures and Reinventure Group (Westpac’s VC arm) have joined forces to launch the first Student Fintech Hack.
				
				Student teams will be given problem scenarios from some of Australia’s brightest fintech startups and have 23 hours to create any solution. The solution can be anything from a simple phone app to an online interactive program - teams simply need to come up with a super-simple but functional prototype to show judges.
				
				Student FinHack is open to all students (both undergrad and postgrad) of varying levels of technical skill. Students from all disciplines are welcome to join as well as first-time hackers. Student FinHack is also dedicated to diversity and we encourage student from all ethnicities, genders, backgrounds, and skill sets to apply.
				
				Throughout the hack students will have the opportunity to be mentored by three top-flight fintechs from Reinventure’s portfolio - the startups will also be running skills workshops for students on idea validation, customer creation, and pitching.
				
				Food and drinks are provided. 
				Built by a student-led team dedicated to building and empowering the largest network of student entrepeneurs across sydney, get your company on the map.</p>

				The Problem Scenario:
				Three of the best fintech startups in Reinventure’s portfolio have come up with three problems they think are opportunities to change the fintech landscape. Teams will choose one of these problems to solve.
				Each problem is intended to be broad and teams are encouraged to use their creative juices to find the best solution to the problem.
				Each fintech startup from Reinventure’s portfolio will manage a problem scenario and teams will have the opportunity to be mentored with these startups to get to the nitty gritty of the problem.

				Who can compete at FinHack?
				FinHack is open to all enrolled university students in Australia who are 17 years and older, including postgrads. We reserve the right to cancel your ticket if you do not meet this requirement.
				How many people can be in a team?
				Teams can have up to five people. 
				Can we work on our idea beforehand?
				The problem scenarios will only be released on the night of the hack’s launch (Friday, 9th August). Generally participants are not allowed to start any development or design work on your project before the hack especially code, graphics, visuals and 3D designs. 
				Students are encouraged however to research the fintech space and the three startups from Reinventure’s portfolio. 
				Can we work on existing projects?
				No, you will not be allowed to work on existing projects at FinHack. However you can synthesis previous ideas, but not tangible products.
				Do I have to stay overnight?
				You are not required to stay overnight. The venue will be closed each night at 7pm and will open again at 7am the next day.  You may work on the project at home.
				I have no hackathon experience can I still take part?
				Of course! We want to encourage as many students to take part as possible. The problem scenarios are designed to be broad to allow participants to use their creativity.
				What’s more, we will run short workshops and mentoring sessions throughout to support you as much as possible. 
				Where can I find people to form a team?
				The best way to find a team is to join the FinHack Facebook Group. There will also be time allotted on the Friday night opening event to meet others and form teams.
				What should I bring?
				A laptop, mobile phone, chargers, and your shiniest thinking caps. 
				Is there a Code of Conduct?
				Yes, there is a code of conduct. FinHack follows "The Hack Code of Conduct". This applies to all attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff. You can view the code of conduct here.
				What if I have additional questions?
				If you have any questions, feel free to shoot us an email at team@unihack.net
